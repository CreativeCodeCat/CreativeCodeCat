I am a Microsoft C# MVP, author, speaker, blogger, developer, 
and creator of WP Requests and WinStore Requests.

I've been involved with computers in one way or another for as long as I can
remember, but started professionally in 1993. Although my primary focus right now
is commercial software applications, I prefer building infrastructure components, 
reusable shared libraries and helping companies define, develop and automate process and
code standards and guidelines.
